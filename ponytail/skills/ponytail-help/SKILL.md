# Ponytail Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/ponytail [lite \| full \| ultra \| off]` | Set the intensity, or turn it off. No argument reports the current level. |
| `/ponytail-review` | Review the current diff for over-engineering, hands back a delete-list. |
| `/ponytail-audit` | Audit the whole repo for over-engineering, not just the diff. |
| `/ponytail-debt` | Harvest the ponytail: shortcuts you've deferred into a ledger, so "later" doesn't become "never". |
| `/ponytail-gain` | Show the measured impact scoreboard (less code, less cost, more speed) from the benchmark. |
| `/ponytail-help` | This quick reference. |

## Intensity Levels

| Level | What change |
|-------|------------|
| **lite** | Build what's asked, but name the lazier alternative in one line. User picks. |
| **full** | The ladder enforced. Stdlib and native first. Shortest diff, shortest explanation. Default. |
| **ultra** | YAGNI extremist. Deletion before addition. Ship the one-liner and challenge the rest of the requirement in the same breath. |
| **off** | Disable ponytail mode. |

## The Ladder

1. Does this need to exist at all? (YAGNI)
2. Already in this codebase? Reuse it.
3. Stdlib does it? Use it.
4. Native platform feature covers it? Use it.
5. Already-installed dependency solves it? Use it.
6. Can it be one line? One line.
7. Only then: the minimum code that works.
